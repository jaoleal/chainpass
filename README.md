# Chainpass, How much we can rely on Crypto(graphy)?

## Abstract

Bitcoin serves as an ideological example of the power of cryptography. The blockchain hosts countless secrets locked behind cryptographic mechanisms like the [Secure Hash Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms), ensuring that they remain securely stored for an indefinite period. The inherent redundancy and immutability of the blockchain make it an ideal medium for publicly storing secrets while keeping them inaccessible to anyone but their rightful owner.

In today's world, passwords are as valuable as currency. They safeguard our digital lives, files, and personal data. It’s only fitting to secure them as we do money—by leveraging the power of blockchain.

Chainpass is a wallet application designed to store passwords on the blockchain using advanced cryptography. By utilizing heavy encryption and robust generation systems, it ensures that passwords remain secure, accessible only by their owner.

Note:
This repository presents a minimal, functional demonstration of the application's potential. It is licensed under the MIT license, and contributions or forks of this idea are welcome.

### Practical Implementation

* The demonstration application will be developed in the Rust programming language, ensuring high performance and security.

* Examples will initially be tested in a closed testnet environment, with potential for migration to other chains if advised.

### Implementation State and timeline.
    [ ] - Up-and-running testnet.
    [ ] - Transaction signing and broadcasting with data commitment.
    [ ] - indexing by txid.
    [ ] - Rebuilding data from chain.
